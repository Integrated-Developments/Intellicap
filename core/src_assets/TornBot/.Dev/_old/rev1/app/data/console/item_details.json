He went by the name of Toxic Terry, and with his deep blue eyes and unruly mop of shaggy blonde hair he persuaded me to take a taste of his \"cocktail\" - which I later discovered was a simple energy drink mixed with petroleum. For the first time in my life I felt alive, and since this revelation I haven't gone more than three hours without combining an energy drink with harmful industrial propellants.

Originally a feature of the American Thanksgiving celebration, the consumption of a turkey at Christmas was popularized by Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" in which Michael Caine makes Kermit the Frog beg for scraps to feed his dying child. Why not commemorate this wholesome yuletide tale by sporting this rubber recreation of the turkey, the planet's driest white meat since Mitch Hedberg.",

As it happens, the tale is merely fictional, and to celebrate Rudolph's triumph over bullying, we present you with this respectful recreation of his glowing iconic hooter. These wearable rubber noses are made from repurposed ball gags, with each one cleaned to a reasonable degree.",
